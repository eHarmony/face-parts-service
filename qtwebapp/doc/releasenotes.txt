Improved security of StaticFileController by denying "/.." in any position in request path.
Improved performance of StaticFileController a little.
New method HttpResponse::redirect(url).
Fixed a missing return in StaticFileController.

Fixed HttpResponse sending first part of data repeatedly when the amount of data is larger than the
available memory for I/O buffer.

1.2.11
06.01.2013
Added clearing the write buffer when accepting a new connection, so that it does not send
remaining data from an aborted previous connection (which is possibly a bug in QT).

18.12.2012
Reduced memory usage of HttpResponse in case of large response.

taken from the cache while it times out.
Modified HttpConnectionHandler so that it does not throw an exception anymore when a connection
gets closed by the peer in the middle of a read.

22.07.2012
Fixed a possible concurrency issue when the file cache is so small that it stores less
files than the number of threads.

Fixed HttpRequest ignores POST parameters of body if there is no Content-Type header.
Removed unused tempdir variable from HttpRequest.
